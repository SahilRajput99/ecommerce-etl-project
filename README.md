# My E-Commerce ETL Project
This is my ETL project with e-commerce data!

## What I Did
- Took sales data from a CSV file.
- Cleaned it and added `TotalPrice`.
- Saved it to a database.
- Made a chart (`top_products.png`).

## Files
- `ecommerce_etl_pipeline.ipynb`: My code and results.
- `top_products.png`: Chart of top products.
- **Data**: Get `data.csv` from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data) (too big to upload here).
- **Database**: `ecommerce.db` is the output (not uploaded due to size).

## How to Run
- Download `data.csv` from the link, then run the notebook in Jupyter!
